# The Toad Outside My Home
there's a toad that lives in a hole right next to my apartment

I have a cigarette with him every night

he usually remains guarded in my presence

keeping watch over his home

he has a family to protect after all

but even a toad needs to catch some fresh air

even if it's only for a moment
