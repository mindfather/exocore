# The Toad Outside My Home
there's a toad that lives in a hole right next to my apartment

![[toad1.jpg]]

I have a cigarette with him every night

![[toad2.jpg]]

he usually remains guarded in my presence

![[toad3.jpg]]

keeping watch over his home

![[toad4.jpg]]

he has a family to protect after all

![[toad5.jpg]]

but even a toad needs to catch some fresh air

even if it's only for a moment
